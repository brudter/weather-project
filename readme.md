# Weather Application

## Description
For this weeks homework, I designed a weather application. 
When I enter the name of a city, it displays said citys temperature, wind speeds, humidity levels, and uv index. Beneath that, it displays a 5 day forecast displaying weather conditions for the week ahead.
